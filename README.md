Welcome to the Church Management System!

The Church Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the administrative tasks of most churches. It is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and 20% C#. ( The migration  and use of azure was in the project so you must customize accordingly when used) 

The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, allowing church staff and volunteers to manage various aspects of church life, including:

* Membership management: track member information, attendance, and involvement in various church activities
* Donation management: record and track donations, including recurring donations and donor information
* Event management: schedule and manage church events, including worship services, meetings, and community outreach programs
* Communication: Submit newsletter

The system is designed to be customizable, allowing churches to tailor it to their specific needs and preferences. It is also scalable, allowing it to grow with the church as its needs change over time.
